# Gesture Control Snake Game

The primary objective of this system shows how a computer game can be played by using human gestures. The secondary objective of this system is to create a system that makes a player to play a game without a physical controller. Our main goal in developing this system was to create a tool that was inspired by leap motion. It is a tool that may be used to virtually control a computer that identifies hand gestures.
